    Fixed bug that caused wrong timestamp-value association due to missing value in raw data

V3.1:
    Upgraded charting library from Protovis to D3.js
    Added filter button to remove high frequencies from large datasets

V3.0:

V2.2: Release!
    Added ability to plot difference in monitored sum and overall total
    Added &fix44=true option to patch chilled data being factor of 40 out
    Fixed non-display of single digit meters

V2.1:
    Fixed bugs which allowed attempt at download of non-existent data
    Added Y Axis scaling buttons for alternative data views
    Added bad data suppression support:
	Added SVG dashed line support in protons
	Added dashed lines for data points which are considered bad by index generator
	Added auto clamping from config file, allowing Y axis power limits on data

V2.0:
    Sensor data awareness, won't extend viewport when no data exists.
    UI overhaul, using bootstrap from Twitter, including loading indicators.
    Added Info, Warning and Error messages when files not found / no data to display etc.
    Added ability to ignore sensors, and/or to avoid them increasing the averages in the tree above.
    Improved code portability
    Added config file support.
    Improved SensorAccessor class, and make use of it
    Fixed page resizing errors
    Added external temperature plotting support
    Added multiple visualisation support
    Added sensor info panel
    Added sensor error index
    Improved visual scheme


V1.9.5:
    Now adds up and sorts multiple plots preventing plots repeating themselves.
    Started frequency testing.


V.1.9:.
    Tool now deals with missing data files, presenting the earliest and latest files at max and min.
    Improved average code.
    Displays N/A in tree when sensors below have differing data dates for average calc.
    Restored S-m27.


V1.8.6:
    Code clean up.
    Added overall meter on load.


V1.8.5:
    Bug fixes.
    Started additions to HTML validation.
    Now uses coverage fields from data in tree and table.
    Now indexes daily meter data.
    Ignores S-m27 meter for release.


V1.8:
    Plots no longer jump colours on sensor changes.
    Added months for which node averages were calculated into tree text.
    Added Google Chrome Frame banner for IE users.
    Added colour swatches in table.
    Added simple caching of sensor files.


V1.7:
    Added support for displaying previous months data as well as the current month. 
    Tidied up the UI, split the time and date below and above the main graph panel.


V1.6:
    Added increased number of plots to be displayed, and general code and UI tweaks


V1.5:
    Added ability for Average nodes to display summation of all nodes beneath them.


V1.4:
    Added Average nodes into the exploration tree.
